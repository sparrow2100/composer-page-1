            Sophie-Carmen Eckhardt-Gramatté was born in Moscow in 1899. She
            started learning music and composing at a young age, starting the
            piano in 1904 and writing her first piano compositions in 1905.
            Eckhardt-Gramatté studied violin, piano and composition at the
            Conservatoire de Paris from 1908-1913, and during this time
            published a composition, an Etude de Concert, in 1910. She went on
            to study violin in Berlin in 1914, and had performed her own works
            in several concert tours of Europe by 1919 when she was just 20
            years old. She lived in Spain from 1924-1926, where she wrote her
            first piano concerto, and toured Germany in 1925 and the USA in
            1929. In 1930 she moved back to Berlin, and gave up performing to
            dedicate her life to composition and pedagogy. It was there that she
            took composition lessons at the Berlin Academy of Arts. She moved to
            Vienna in 1936 and continued composition there, then moved to
            Winnipeg, Canada in 1953. There she continued to compose and teach,
            having as one of her students the renowned Canadian violinist Gwen
            Thompson. In 1970 she received an honorary doctorate from Brandon
            University in Manitoba, and in 1974 became the subject of a CBC
            documentary. Her music and old performances can now be found in
            Radio Canada International’s Anthology of Canadian Music (ACM).

            Throughout her composing career Eckhardt-Gramatté utilized many
            different techniques and styles, including but not limited to
            serialism, metric manipulation, jazz idioms, neo-classicism, and
            bitonality. Her ten caprices for solo violin not only demonstrate
            many of these techniques, but paint vivid pictures of the story
            behind each one. Additionally, her works are extremely difficult to
            perform and demonstrate her virtuosity as a performer. Although her
            music can be considered experimental and forward-thinking, she cites
            major influences as J.S. Bach and the First Viennese school.

        Here is a selection of S.C. Eckhardt-Gramatté's works, which serve to
        demonstrate her skill in composition on both the violin and piano, and
        the range of styles her works encompass. The first piece,
        <em>Le Départ D'un Train</em>, comes with a story which it illustrates:
        <em
          >"[it] was written in 1928 in Barbizon, France, shortly after the
          moving farewell from her sick husband at the railway station in
          Berlin. Combining the noises of the departing train, running sometimes
          faster, sometimes slower, driving uphill then down with the reflecting
          feelings, imagination and will to create, the caprice was born."
          (-Francis Chaplin)</em
        >
        This is one of many caprices for solo violin which are often categorized
        in the same class as Paganini caprices, which are incredibly difficult
        and renowned for their virtuosity.
